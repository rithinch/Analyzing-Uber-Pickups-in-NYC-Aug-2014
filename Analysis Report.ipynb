I need to split the data in Date/Time column and store the required individual values in new columns. Three most important values I will be focusing on for analysing trends in pickup times are Hours of the day, Days of the month, and Days of the week; For storing these important values I will be adding three new columns.\n\n1.\tHour –stores the hour of the day value from the Date/Time column.\n2.\tDay – stores the day of the month value from the Date/Time column.\n3.\tWeekday – stores the respective weekday from the Date/Time column.\n\nTo implement this in R language, I have used ‘readr’ for reading the raw data in .csv file.

We can notice that the visualization has more blue points than black ones. This means that over the period of August 2014, majority of the pickups were made during weekdays 4-6 i.e. Thursdays – Saturdays. There is a lot more demand on Thursdays – Saturdays than other days. Hence, the prediction of ‘increasing Uber demand nearer to weekends’ made when analysing the data is proved correct. One interesting observation we can make is that majority of the pickups on a Sunday are in Manhattan.

We can observe that Manhattan area in plotted graph has slightly more blue points than other locations; meaning, many of pickups are made in Manhattan during 15-21 hours.
